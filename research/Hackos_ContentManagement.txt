Embodied in the architectures
These principles [topic orientation, information typing, specialization, inheritable processes] are embodied in two architectures.
Information architecture
The information architecture desires what a topic is and what the three core information types are (concept, procedure, and reference).  . . . 
Specialization architecture
The specialization architecture describes how new information types of topic are derived from more general types of a topic, and how specialization-aware processes can access topics at whatever level of specialization they require.
